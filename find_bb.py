Use this script to draw initial bounding boxes on videos.

This script is meant to work hand in hand with tracking.py. To label a new
video, you should first annotate bounding boxes on the video's first frame with
this script, and then load the video into tracking.py to track the bounding
boxes.

To label an object, you should first pick the class that the object belongs to,
by pressing any (lowercase) alphanumeric character on your keyboard. This will
set the class to be that single character, e.g. 'v', 'a', 's', 'u', etc. After
picking a class, you can use your mouse to click on two opposing corners of a
box around an object. After you click the second point, the object will be
labeled with the class you specified earlier. At this point, you can change the
class, or draw another box with the same class.

Once you're satisfied with the boxes you've drawn, you can exit the program by
pressing 'q'. This also means that 'q' is not a valid object class.

If you would like to clear the first point you selected, you can press Escape.
If you would like to remove a bounding box you've drawn already, you should
simply restart the program, which will clear all bounding boxes.

Finally, you should try to make bounding boxes drawn here as tight as possible.
Any scaling of bounding boxes that needs to be performed can be done in
tracking.py.
