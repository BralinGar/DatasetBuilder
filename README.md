# DatasetBuilder
> Utilize cv2 tracking to track a bounding box to your objects in a video. Creates the image files of the video and the annotation data in PASCAL VOC format. This data can then be trained by utilzing the Object Detection with TensorFlow Lite Model Maker found https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/tutorials/model_maker_object_detection.ipynb
## FTC Notes
- If you are not already using FTC-ML(FTC Machine Learning Tool Chain), please use the FTC-ML as it provides better resources and accessibility to most FTC Teams
- 
- Only use this method
